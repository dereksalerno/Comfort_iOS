# Comfort_iOS

This is an app that I developed for iOS back in 2013. Its primary purpose was to allow guests in a bar with an enormous collection of whiskey to keep track of which they had tried, save tasting notes, and leave a star rating behind for future reference. It was intended both as a marketing tool as well as a solution to the problem of endless printing and very long, overwhelming lists.

The app loads information from an XML, allowing easy updates. All user ratings and notes are stored in a SQLite database on the local storage.
